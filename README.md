PinIt by JMMZ

(i.e. explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, features, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.)

 ** Description
What your project is / should be used for
What problem(s) your projects solves

Have you ever planned to travel to a location and want to find the best spots around? 'PinIt' is a social app that utilizes the Google Maps API to allow users to keep a log of their favorite places. Users can place pins for these locations and see where other users have pinned locations. You can add descriptions and images to their pins to personlize them. The Google Maps API allows users to search for specific addresses and also click exactly where they want their pin to be located. 


 ** Brief Example
This could be a code snippet showing how your project should be used (if it is meant to be integrated into another app)
This could be a screenshot of your project running in the browser (if it is a stand-alone application)

[SCREENSHOTS]

 ** List of Features / User Stories
This typically will be a short list of the features / user stories that you planned during the development phase of the project
To provide more detail, you can show how you categorized these features into Bronze (MVP), Silver, and Gold Levels and indicate which features you complete / have yet to complete

Features Implemented:

- Token Authorization
- Display maps with User generated pins and rend
- When creating a pin, we implemented a search bar that allows the users to easily search for any address or city all over the globe using the Google Maps Places API
- Sidebar that has a list view of all the pins. (More features for sidebar pending.)
- Navbar updates to show who is currently signed in. 
- Dropbox like feature for uploading images.
- 


 ** List of Technologies Used
Often you will want to list the technologies you used to create the project.
This typically would consist of all primary languages, frameworks, and libraries your app is composed of
This is particularly important when it comes to recruiters scanning your projects for keywords


Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, MongoDB Atlas / Mongoose, Image Upload with Cloudinary, bcrypt, axios, JSON Web Token Authorization, Google Maps API (Map, Places, Geocoding), styled components, and React.


 ** Installation Instructions / Getting Started
This section should walk a reader, step by step, through the process of setting up your project
For a tool meant to be integrated into other projects, this would likely outline the process of installing and accessing this tool in your project
For an application, this would likely outline the process of forking, cloning, and starting the app locally

- Clone down repository.
- Run 'npm i' to install dependencies.

README for backend:

(i.e. explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, features, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.)

 ** Description
What your project is / should be used for
What problem(s) your projects solves

'Places-GA' is a social app that utilizes the Google Maps API to allow users to keep a log of their favorite places. Users can place pins for these locations and see where other users have pinned locations. Users can add descriptions and images to their pins to personlize them. 

Google Maps API allows users to search for specific addresses and click exactly where they want their pin to be located. 


 ** Brief Example
This could be a code snippet showing how your project should be used (if it is meant to be integrated into another app)
This could be a screenshot of your project running in the browser (if it is a stand-alone application)

[SCREENSHOTS]

 ** List of Features / User Stories
This typically will be a short list of the features / user stories that you planned during the development phase of the project
To provide more detail, you can show how you categorized these features into Bronze (MVP), Silver, and Gold Levels and indicate which features you complete / have yet to complete

### User stories

MVP:

As a user, I want to be able to add pins of my favorite locations.
<br>
As a user, I would like the pins I create to be categorized by cities.
<br>
As a user, my pins should have CRUD functionality.
<br>
As a user, I want to be able to see my pins on the map.
<br>
As a user, I would like to see other pins that people have posted.
<br>
As a user, I want to be able to sign up (OAuth) or create a new account (Tokens).
<br>
As a user, I would like to have a profile page that has a list of my pins.
<br>

Stretch Goals:

As a user, when adding a new pin, I would like the search bar to auto-populate the location name.
<br>
As a user, I would like to add comments on other peopleâ€™s pins.
<br>
As a user, I want my password to be encrypted (bcrypt).
<br>
As a user, I would like to have suggestions based on current pins.
<br>
As a user, I would like to be able to add images to my pins.




 ** List of Technologies Used
Often you will want to list the technologies you used to create the project.
This typically would consist of all primary languages, frameworks, and libraries your app is composed of
This is particularly important when it comes to recruiters scanning your projects for keywords


Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, MongoDB Atlas / Mongoose, Multer / Cloudinary, bcrypt, axios, JSON Web Token Authorization, Google Maps API (Map, Places, Geocoding), styled components, and React.


 ** Installation Instructions / Getting Started
This section should walk a reader, step by step, through the process of setting up your project
For a tool meant to be integrated into other projects, this would likely outline the process of installing and accessing this tool in your project
For an application, this would likely outline the process of forking, cloning, and starting the app locally

- Clone down repository.

- Run 'npm i' to install dependencies.

 ** Contribution Guidelines
This section should offer guidance on where and how users can contribute to your code, identify bugs, and propose improvements

Good links to include are:
A link to the project's main repository
A link to the project's issue tracker

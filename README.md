PinIt by JMMZ

### Description

Have you ever planned to travel to a location and want to find the best spots around? 'PinIt' is a social app that utilizes the Google Maps API to allow users to keep a log of their favorite places. Users can place pins for these locations and see where other users have pinned locations. You can add descriptions and images to their pins to personlize them. The Google Maps API allows users to search for specific addresses and also click exactly where they want their pin to be located.
